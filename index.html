            <p>During my sophomore year of high school,
                we were doing silent work and my history teacher said that we could listen to music but if it was too
                loud
                he would "break our headphones". so I'm doing my work quietly with my music on low, and this obnoxious
                kid sitting next to me had his music really loud.
                I could hear it over my music but ignored it. My teacher thought it was me . So he comes up to me &
                ripped my
                <span class="highlight">BRAND NEW Apple headphones</span>, looking ruthless. He suddenly realized it was
                the guy next to
                me and he was completely embarassed. He came in the next day with a new pair and an apology note tapped
                to them. He could'nt look me in the eye for the rest of the year.
